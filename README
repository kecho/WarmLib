cross platform process worker pool manager library
==================================================


WarmLib is a cross platform multiprocess manager library that provides the developers
easy ways to:

- Create a programatically manageble process worker pool
- Develop plugins that attach to a WarmLib worker process from this worker pool for custom jobs
- Programatically providing c++ classes / event listeners / interfaces to manage / send and receive jobs from 
  the custom plugin running under a worker pool.
